Labinvaders
==========

A simple Space Invaders clone made with [Laboratory2d](http://laboratory2d.com/)
to learn how to use it.

Things that you can do to improve the code on your own as an exercise:

+ Make an Entity class to save code
+ Make the fire rate code framerate independent by using timers, I couldn't do this because of a broken build causing the time to not get updated properly
